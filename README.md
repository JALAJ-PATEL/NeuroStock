## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JALAJ-PATEL/NeuroStock.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd NeuroStock

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    python -m venv .venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\.venv\Scripts\activate

    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
    
5. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Running the App

## Model Overview

The project uses an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The model is enhanced with technical indicators and uses a **Bidirectional LSTM** architecture for better performance. The model is trained using stock price data obtained from **Yahoo Finance**. It uses the following approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Data is scaled using `MinMaxScaler` and split into training and testing datasets.
   - Added features: Moving Averages (MA20, MA50), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands.
   
2. **Model Training**:
   - A Bidirectional LSTM model is trained on the past 150 days of stock data.
   - Dropout layers are added to prevent overfitting.
   
3. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the model's accuracy.
    - The model's predictions are visualized alongside actual stock prices.

## Predictions & Visualizations

The Streamlit app provides:

- **Dynamic EMA Visualization:** Customize short-term and long-term EMA spans.
- **Detailed Performance Metrics:** Display Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Predicted Price Summary:** Maximum, minimum, and average predicted prices.
- **Downloadable Data:** Export predicted vs. actual stock prices as a CSV file.
